## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?
- I really enjoyed the SuperLearner Article, it reflected the importance of a learning headspace, and I liked that it was concise and to the point. I am glad to report that I already view learning as a process, and not just a means to an end. It was refreshing and centering to be reminded of the importance of the journey. I definitely need to make sure that I take frequent breaks, as I tend to get "in-the-zone" and forget to take breaks. I found the list to be complete, and I enjoyed the quick and effective read!

1. How would you print the string `"Hello World!"` to the terminal?
`p "Hello, World!"`

1. What character is used to indicate comments in a ruby file?
- An octothorp, or hash is used to indicate comments. #

1. Explain the difference between an integer and a float?
- An integer is a whole number, whereas a float is an integer that has a decimal point, even if that decimal point is a zero.

1. In the space below, create a variable `animal` that holds the string `"zebra"`
- `animal = "zebra"`

1. How would you print the string `"zebra"` using the variable that you created above?
- `p animal`

1. What is interpolation? Use interpolation to print a sentence using the variable `animal`.
- Interpolation is calling a previously assigned string from within another string. \
`p "The #{animal} is an undeniably cool animal."`

1. What method is used to get input from a user?
- `gets.chomp` is used to get input from a user.

1. Name and describe two common string methods:
- String interpolation, which embeds the assigned value of an variable `#{}` inside of another string,
and concatenation, which is essentially "glueing" strings together. An example below \
```
puts "I sure love + #{animal}"    # => string interpolation
a = "This is an"
b = "example of string concatenation"
puts a + b

```
