# A comment, so you can read your program later.
# Anything after the # (hash) is ignored by ruby.

puts "I could have code like this." #And this comment is ignored

#You can also use a comment to "disable" or comment out a piece of code:
# puts "This won't run."

puts "This will run."
# putting an octothorpe inside of a string will void the hash.
puts "Reading your code backwards is a trick to catch coding errors."
